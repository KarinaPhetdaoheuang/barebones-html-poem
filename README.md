# I Died for Beauty - but was Scarce by Emily Dickinson 

<p><pre>I died for Beauty - but was scarce
Adjusted in the Tomb
When One who died for Truth, was lain
In an adjoining Room -</p>

<p>He questioned softly "Why I failed"?
"For Beauty", I replied -
"And I - for Truth - Themself are One -
We Brethren are",  He said -</p>

<p>And so, as Kinsmen, met a Night â€”
We talked between the Rooms -
Until the Moss had reached our lips -
And covered up  - Our names -  </p> </pre>
